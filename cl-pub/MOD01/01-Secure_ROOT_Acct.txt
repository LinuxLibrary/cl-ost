Most important and major concern in hosting a public cloud is we need to secure our ROOT account.
This account is similar to the root account in our Linux machines which has the high level privs.

Below are the steps to secure a root account.
From the IAM console you need to generate your unique login url.
After that you need to do the following steps:

1. Delete your root access keys
2. Activate MFA on your root account
3. Create individual IAM users
4. Use groups to assign permissions
5. Apply an IAM password policy
